 *
 *
 *
 * A model starts out in the PREPARING state. In the PREPARING state, directives can be modified.
 *
 * From the PREPARING state, a data split can be created.
 * If the split succeeds, the model moves to DATA_READY. If the split fails, the model moves to SPLIT_FAILED.
 *
 * From the SPLIT_FAILED state, a new split can be created in case the failure was a transient failure. The split
 * can also be unassigned, which brings the model back to the PREPARING state.
 *
 * From the DATA_READY state, the split can be unassigned, which moves it to PREPARING. The model can also be
 * trained, which moves it to TRAINING.
 *
 * From TRAINING, it moves to TRAINED if the model training succeeds.
 * If the training failed, it moves to TRAINING_FAILED.
 *
 * From the TRAINED state, it can be deployed, which moves it to DEPLOYED.
 *
 * From the TRAINING_FAILED state, it can be trained again, which moves it to the TRAINING state. The split can also
 * be unassigned, which moves it back to the PREPARING state.
