    <description>
      This password is used when generating keys to encrypt and decrypt data that is written to
      the secure store. If the password is changed, all existing data in the secure store
      will become invalid and should be deleted. This is only used for the 'file' secure store
      provider. In distributed environments, the 'kms' secure store provider should be used instead.
