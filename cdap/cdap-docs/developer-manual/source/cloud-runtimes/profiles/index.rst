Profiles consist of a provisioner name and provisioner configuration settings. They can be
created by CDAP admins and assigned to batch pipelines. When a pipeline is assigned to a pipeline,
CDAP will use the provisioner specified in the profile to create a cluster, run the pipeline on
that cluster, then tear down the cluster after the run has finished.
