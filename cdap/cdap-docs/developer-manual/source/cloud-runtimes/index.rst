Cloud Runtimes allow you to configure batch pipelines to run in a cloud environment.
Before the pipeline runs, a cluster is provisioned in the cloud. The pipeline is
executed on that cluster, and the cluster is deleted after the run finishes. Cloud Runtimes allow
you to only use compute resources when you need them, allowing you to make better use of
your resources.
