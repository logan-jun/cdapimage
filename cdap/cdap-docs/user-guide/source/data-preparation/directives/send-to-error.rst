=============
Send to Error
=============

The SEND-TO-ERROR directive allows the filtering of records and directs
the filtered records that match a given condition to an error collector.
If the error collector is not connected as the next stage in a pipeline,
then the filtered records will be dropped.

Syntax
------

::

    send-to-error <condition>

The ``<condition>`` is a JEXL expression specifing the condition that
governs if the record should be sent to the error collector.

Usage Notes
-----------

The most common use of the SEND-TO-ERROR directive is to filter out
records that are not part of clean data. This is a data cleansing
directive to remove records that do not conform to specified rules.

The record is sent to the error collector (if connected) when the
condition for the record evaluates to ``true``. If the condition
evaluates to ``false``, the record is passed on untouched.

Example
-------

Assume a record that has these three fields:

-  Name
-  Age
-  DOB

As part of a data cleansing process, check that all the records being
ingested follow these rules:

-  ``Name`` is not empty
-  ``Age`` is not empty and not less than 1 or greater 130
-  ``DOB`` is a valid date

These directives will implement these rules; any records that match any
of these conditions will be sent to the error collector for further
investigation:

::

    send-to-error Name == null
    send-to-error Age.isEmpty()
    send-to-error Age < 1 || Age > 130
    send-to-error !date:isDate(DOB)
