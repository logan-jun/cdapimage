=================
DataPrep Concepts
=================

This implementation of Data Prep uses the concepts of *Record*,
*Column*, *Directive*, *Step*, and *Pipeline*.

Record
~~~~~~

A *Record* is a collection of field names and field values.

Column
~~~~~~

A *Column* is a data value of any of the supported Java types, one for
each record.

Directive
~~~~~~~~~

A *Directive* is a single data manipulation instruction, specified to
either transform, filter, or pivot a single record into zero or more
records. A directive can generate one or more *steps* to be executed by
a pipeline.

Step
~~~~

A *Step* is an implementation of a data transformation function,
operating on a single record or set of records. A step can generate zero
or more records from the application of a function.

Pipeline
~~~~~~~~

A *Pipeline* is a collection of steps to be applied on a record. The
record(s) outputed from a step are passed to the next step in the
pipeline.

Notations
---------

Directives
~~~~~~~~~~

A directive can be represented in text in this format:

::

    <command> <argument-1> <argument-2> ... <argument-n>

Record
~~~~~~

A record in this documentation will be shown as a JSON object with an
object key representing the column names and a value shown by the plain
representation of the the data, without any mention of types.

For example:

::

    {
      "id": 1,
      "fname": "root",
      "lname": "joltie",
      "address": {
        "housenumber": "678",
        "street": "Mars Street",
        "city": "Marcity",
        "state": "Maregon",
        "country": "Mari"
      },
      "gender": "M"
    }
