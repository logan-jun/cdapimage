Analytics is an application that provides a simple, interactive, UI-driven approach to machine learning.

Machine learning means different things to different people. We define machine learning as using
`what you know` to make predictions about `what you don't know`, such as using existing home sales
data to make predictions about how much a house will sell for.

Machine learning is often seen as a complicated process that requires advanced training.
CDAP Analytics lowers that bar, allowing users of any level to understand their data and train models
while preserving the switches and levers that advanced users might want to tweak.
