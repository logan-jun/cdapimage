===========================================
CDAP Authorization Extension using Datasets
===========================================

Overview
========

This project contains a CDAP authorization extension using a custom dataset (``ACLDataset``) to store authorization
policies. It implements the CDAP
`Authorizer <https://github.com/cdapio/cdap/blob/develop/cdap-security/src/main/java/io/cdap/cdap/security/authorization/Authorizer.java>`_
interface to achieve this integration. The ACLDataset is created in the ``cdap_system`` HBase namespace.

Building
========

To build the CDAP Authorization Dataset Extension and run tests, execute the following command from the
``cdap-authorization-dataset-extn`` root directory::

  $ mvn clean package


To skip tests, execute::

   $ mvn clean package -DskipTests


Deploying
=========

To deploy this authorization extension:

- Install the ``cdap-authorization-dataset-extn/target/cdap-authorization-dataset-extension-*.jar`` at a
known location on your CDAP Master host.
- Set these properties in the ``cdap-site.xml`` that CDAP Master uses:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Value
   * - ``security.authorization.extension.jar.path``
     - Absolute path of the ``cdap-authorization-dataset-extension-*.jar`` on the local file system of the CDAP Master.
   * - ``security.authorization.extension.config.cdap.superusers``
     - Comma-separated list of super users. Super users are authorized to perform all operations on all entities.
